## [0.3.0] - 2026-09-11

### Problem

Agent Gorgon could only watch a PID that was already running, so seeing what a real agent
session does meant finding its PID by hand first, and the only packaged scope allowed paths
(`~/agent-workspace`, `/tmp/my-agent`) that no real coding agent uses. The documented path to a
first result was several manual steps and a scope that produced nothing but noise.

### Added
- `agent-gorgon run [options] -- <command...>`: launch a command and watch the process tree it
  creates, instead of looking up a PID by hand first. Audit-only by default (`--enforce` opts in
  to active SIGSTOP/SIGKILL controls), forwards the command's exit status (`128+N` for a signal
  death), inherits stdio so the command keeps stdout, writes the action evidence JSONL to
  `--out`, and prints a one-line `agent-gorgon run: mode=... observed=... would-halt=...`
  summary to stderr. The command runs in its own process group and is given the terminal
  foreground when stdin is a TTY, so interactive agents stay usable; SIGINT/SIGTERM sent to the
  watcher are relayed to that group after a SIGCONT, bounded by `--shutdown-grace`, so a paused
  tree is never left stopped. If the scope fails to load or the watcher cannot start, the
  spawned command is terminated instead of running unwatched.
- Packaged `--scope coding-agent` starter scope (`agent_warden/scopes/coding-agent.yaml`, mirrored
  at `examples/scope.coding-agent.yaml`), written for a coding agent launched with
  `agent-gorgon run`. It allows the launch directory (`./**`) plus the toolchain caches and
  read-only system trees a build touches, so ordinary work stays quiet; reads of `~/.ssh`,
  `~/.aws`, `~/.gnupg`, `~/.config/gcloud`, `~/.config/gh`, `~/.netrc`, `~/.git-credentials`,
  `~/.npmrc` and key material (`.pem`, `.key`, `.p12`) are KILL verdicts; `curl`, `wget`, `nc`,
  `socat`, `ssh`, `scp`, `rsync`, `sudo` and friends are forbidden commands; paste/exfil sinks are
  forbidden domains. `resolve_scope_path` now resolves any name in the new `PACKAGED_SCOPES`
  table, so `--scope coding-agent` works from a bare `pip install` in both `run` and PID mode.
- Optional `filesystem.workspace_paths` scope key: the trees walked for the create/delete snapshot
  diff. Allowing a broad read-only tree (`/usr/**`, `~/.cache/**`) no longer implies walking it
  every snapshot. When the key is absent the snapshot falls back to `allowed_paths`, so existing
  scopes are unaffected.

### Fixed
- Stdio a watched tree inherited from `agent-gorgon run` (for example the operator's own
  `> session.log` redirect) is no longer reported as out-of-workspace file activity by the
  agent. `ProcessObserver` accepts the launcher's fd 0/1/2 real paths and skips exactly those
  descriptors; a path the agent opens itself gets a different fd and is still observed.
- Relative `allowed_paths` / `forbidden_paths` patterns (`"./**"`) now resolve against the
  directory Agent Gorgon runs from instead of silently matching nothing, and a relative snapshot
  root is made absolute so evidence targets stay absolute. With `agent-gorgon run` that directory
  is the operator's repository, which is what makes `./**` mean "this project".
- `.zenodo.json` now carries the current project identity (title "Agent Gorgon", the current
  version) so the Zenodo record minted from a GitHub release matches `CITATION.cff` and
  `pyproject.toml`. The 0.2.0 release record (10.5281/zenodo.22315879) was archived under the
  retired "agent-warden" title and version 0.1.5 because this file was stale.

### Changed
- `README.md` now leads with `pip install agent-gorgon && agent-gorgon run --audit-only --scope
  coding-agent -- <your agent command>` as the first success, with the one-line summary and the
  "read the evidence before you enforce" step alongside it. The wrapper section follows directly;
  attaching to an already-running process is now "Advanced: attach to an already-running process".
  Rollout guidance, the name-targeting caveat and the "watches a supplied PID" claim were updated
  to describe both modes accurately. `AGENTS.md` and `llms.txt` list the wrapper first for the
  same reason. No support claim changed: CI still covers Python 3.9-3.12 on Ubuntu, and macOS,
  Windows and Python 3.13+ remain UNEVALUATED.
- `CLAUDE.md` now describes the actual layout: the implementation lives in `agent_warden/`
  (`warden.py` holds Scope, LLMJudge, IncidentLogger, Killswitch, ProcessObserver and the Warden
  loop; the other modules are re-export facades), `agent_gorgon/` is the canonical namespace,
  and the listed commands are the ones CI runs (`pytest -q`, `ruff check .`,
  `mypy agent_gorgon agent_warden`, both `python -m build` targets) plus the `agent-gorgon*`
  console commands. Evidence paths, the `--audit-only` / `--no-llm` flags, the `qwen3:4b`
  advisory default and the version-pin locations are now stated as they are in the code.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` lists the CI check commands and the `agent_gorgon` module smoke
  commands instead of the retired `agent_warden` ones; `AGENTS.md` names `agent-gorgon`
  as the product; `docs/AUDIT_CHECKLIST.md` pins the current version instead of 0.1.7.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-04

### Problem

An installed `agent-gorgon` user had no way to see attribution, false-trigger, or overhead
evidence for their own copy without cloning the repository and running `examples/harness/`
by hand. The audit-only workload proof only existed as source-checkout scripts, so it was
unreachable from a bare `pip install`.

### Added
- `agent-gorgon-audit-demo` console command: a packaged, one-command owned-process audit
  demo that runs only child processes it spawns and owns in `--audit-only` mode, printing a
  machine-readable attribution / false-trigger / overhead JSON receipt. Works from a bare
  `pip install agent-gorgon` with no repository checkout. The scenarios, harness, and scope
  template now live in `agent_warden.audit_demo` (re-exported as `agent_gorgon.audit_demo`);
  `examples/harness/workload_fixtures.py` and `run_audit_workload.py` are thin compatibility
  wrappers over the same code, not a second implementation.

### Evidence
- Installed-wheel proof: built `agent_gorgon-0.2.0-py3-none-any.whl`, installed it into an
  isolated venv with no repository on `sys.path`, and ran `agent-gorgon-audit-demo` from
  `/tmp` -- 3/3 scenarios matched ground truth (`safe_workspace_write` -> SAFE,
  `suspicious_child_name` -> HALT, `forbidden_extension_write` -> KILL), exit 0,
  `false_trigger_or_miss_count: 0`. This is a 3-scenario smoke check confirming the packaged
  command reaches an installed user, not a statistical false-positive rate (see
  `docs/EVIDENCE.md`).
- Full suite: 228 tests collected and passing, including the new
  `tests/test_audit_demo_packaging.py` packaging regression guard.
- Overhead is measured, not certified: the watcher polls the target from a separate process
  (it does not instrument or sandbox the target's own execution), so cost is the watcher's own
  CPU time only, which scaled with `--poll` in this harness (~43% of one core at `0.05s`,
  ~10% at the `0.5s` default), plus ~0.05-0.15s of watcher process startup/shutdown reflected
  in wall clock. These are order-of-magnitude numbers from one macOS ARM environment, not a
  cross-platform benchmark; see `docs/EVIDENCE.md` for the full measurement and its caveats.
- Agent Gorgon does not sandbox or prevent anything before it happens: it observes a process
  tree already running and, outside audit-only mode, reacts to a matching action after the
  fact via `SIGSTOP`/`SIGKILL`. This release does not change that scope.

## [0.1.8] - 2026-08-04

### Changed
- `agent_gorgon` is now the canonical Python import namespace; new integrations should use it.
- `agent-gorgon` and `agent-gorgon-forensic` are the primary console commands.
- The unpublished `suy-sideguy` compatibility shim now targets `agent-gorgon==0.1.8` and
  directs users to the canonical Gorgon imports and commands.

### Deprecated
- `agent_warden` imports and the `agent-warden` / `agent-warden-forensic` commands remain
  available for this transition release and forward to the Gorgon implementation with a visible
  deprecation notice for legacy commands.

## [0.1.7] - 2026-08-04

### Added
- `--audit-only` provides a non-signaling calibration path that records verdicts
  and evidence without attempting `SIGSTOP` or `SIGKILL`.
- A safe first-use walkthrough monitors a disposable process before users apply
  active controls to a real agent workload.
- `agent-gorgon` command aliases and a packaged `starter` scope make an installed
  wheel independently usable without a repository checkout.

### Changed
- Public positioning now leads with the concrete product category, runtime
  policy guard, while keeping user-space polling and enforcement limits explicit.
- Package, command, release, platform-support, and source-versus-PyPI boundaries
  are stated together so users can tell what is available in each build.
- The PyPI workflow now tests, lints, type-checks, builds, inspects, and smoke-tests
  the exact release artifact before requesting trusted publication.
- Release actions are pinned to immutable commits, and the uploaded wheel is
  handed from a read-only build job to the OIDC publishing job.
- Runtime evidence now lives under an Agent Gorgon-owned private directory.
- Incident handling preserves non-mutating remediation guidance instead of moving
  files observed during a control event.

### Fixed
- CLI help no longer labels source-only `--audit-only` behavior with the wrong
  public package version.
- Runtime controls bind to process identity and report stop/exit only after
  observing that outcome; ambiguous name targeting is rejected.
- Scope types and thresholds are validated before monitoring, and built-in SSH
  protection is narrowed to recognized private-key and credential material.

## [0.1.6] - 2026-07-22

### Changed
- GitHub repository renamed `agent-warden` -> `agent-gorgon` to match the PyPI
  distribution name. Imports (`agent_warden`) and the `agent-warden` /
  `agent-warden-forensic` CLIs are unchanged. First release published to PyPI.
- The unpublished `suy-sideguy` compatibility candidate now matches
  `agent-gorgon==0.1.6`; the earlier 0.1.5 target had no satisfiable
  `agent-gorgon==0.1.5` release.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-07-20

### Changed
- **Agent Warden is the canonical identity** — the primary distribution is `agent-warden`,
  imports use `agent_warden`, and the CLIs are `agent-warden` and `agent-warden-forensic`.
- **Suy Sideguy is a time-bounded compatibility shim** — `suy-sideguy==0.1.5` depends on
  exactly `agent-gorgon==0.1.5` (the PyPI distribution of Agent Warden), forwards historical imports and commands, and emits
  deprecation diagnostics. The proposed default removal is Agent Warden 0.4.0, no earlier
  than 2026-10-10 and only after the owner records the release flip.

### Fixed
- **Prior exact-review blockers closed** — shell `-c` parsing preserves the command-string boundary,
  advisory LLM fanout is bounded to one in-flight task, and completed advisory evidence is persisted.
- **Evidence claims are outcome-bound** — a failed or partial process-tree SIGKILL attempt stays
  retryable and its report no longer claims that the process terminated; retries update one episode
  report without repeating rollback, and report generator metadata now matches 0.1.5.
- **Runtime and privacy claims are explicit** — snapshot deletes are documented as unattributed and
  non-enforcing, nonexistent audit/confirm modes are no longer advertised, `--no-llm` disables local
  Ollama traffic, and raw-IP checks no longer use untrusted/leaky reverse DNS.
- **HALT now attempts control** — a HALT verdict attempts to SIGSTOP the agent process tree
  (reversible pause) and records the observed outcome in a forensic report. Later HALTs reconcile
  the visible process state before suppressing a signal, and failed one-shot attempts retry without
  duplicating the episode report. Previously HALT only logged and the agent kept running.
- **LLM judge is advisory-only** — the Ollama judge can no longer emit KILL/HALT (schema is SAFE/FLAG; anything else is coerced to FLAG) and runs off the enforcement hot path, closing the blind-window DoS on the monitor. KILL and SIGSTOP remain the deterministic rule engine's exclusive authority.
- **Credential-read plus non-local network egress KILLs deterministically** when an external socket
  is active at read time or a new external connection appears inside the correlation window. A bare
  network-out stays HALT/FLAG, and the complete IP loopback ranges stay SAFE without disarming a
  later external-egress correlation. A close followed by a reopen or reconnect emits a fresh
  observation instead of being suppressed by lifetime de-duplication.
- **In-process deletes are now observed** — poll-time filesystem diff of scope roots emits synthetic
  FILE_DELETE/FILE_WRITE actions (`os.remove` opens no fd, so `psutil.open_files()` alone was blind
  to them). Literal symlink roots such as macOS `/tmp` are opened through a pinned concrete target
  while evidence retains the configured path spelling; descendant symlinks are not traversed.
- **No more SIGKILL on benign dev work** — rate-limit breaches do not kill, and conventional
  relative project/build cleanup inside the filesystem allowlist remains low-noise. Arbitrary
  recursive-delete operands outside the allowlist HALT reversibly instead of becoming SAFE through an allowed shell;
  `rm -rf` on protected roots (`~/.ssh`, `~/.aws`, `~/.gnupg`) still KILLs, including the bare
  directory (contents-glob regression closed).
- **Relative recursive-delete targets use the observed child cwd** — `sh -c 'rm -rf .ssh'`
  launched from the user's home now resolves to the protected credential directory; if child-cwd
  observation is unavailable, the Warden HALTs instead of guessing SAFE. Known project cwd cleanup
  such as `build/` and `.venv` remains benign.
- **Recursive-delete wrapper and glob bypasses are closed** — supported `env` execution wrappers,
  including `env -C`, are reduced before classification; root/home ancestors and first-level glob
  forms such as `/**`, `/.*`, `~/**`, `$HOME*`, and `~/..` no longer classify SAFE. Unsupported
  wrapper, dynamic-option, command-substitution, or shell-expansion semantics HALT reversibly,
  while literal project-scoped cleanup remains benign. Observed direct argv preserves literal
  metacharacters instead of re-expanding them as shell text. Forbidden-glob intersections are
  decided symbolically without recursively enumerating the filesystem on the monitoring hot path.
- **Shipped generic scope enforced nothing** — `examples/scope.generic.yaml` used a flat schema the parser silently read as empty allowlists; rewritten nested, and `Scope` now fails loud on legacy flat-schema keys.

### Added
- Regression coverage for enforcement outcomes, observer limits, packaging compatibility, and
  protected-delete countercontrols.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-05-30

### Added
- DOI-readiness metadata (CITATION.cff, .zenodo.json). Tagged `v0.1.4` on GitHub; not published to PyPI.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-03-08

### Added
- **HALT verdict** — new escalation level between FLAG and KILL. Dangerous patterns freeze the agent and alert the operator without killing the process.
- **HALT triggers**: 3+ file deletions in 10 seconds; curl/wget process spawned; 50+ network calls in 60 seconds (bulk messaging pattern); writes outside allowed workspace.
- **Hardcoded KILL triggers**: SSH key file access (`~/.ssh/`, `*id_rsa*`, `*id_ed25519*`); modification of `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`; `rm -rf` on non-tmp paths.
- `intent_match.py` — standalone module for classifying instruction intent (READ/WRITE/DELETE/NETWORK/SPAWN) and detecting intent-action mismatches.
